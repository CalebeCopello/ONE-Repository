## First Class

Nowadays, it's necessary to learn more than only one thing deeply. We have more moments in our lives that we need to learn new skills and abilities. There’s a concept called “ikigai”, that’s a mix of something you love to do, something you are good at, something that’s someone is willing to pay you to do and something that the world needs.

What are the paths to learn? (Kolb theory)
4 ways to learn:
Accommodate: learns with what the others have to say
Divergent: learns discussing ideas
Convergent: learns solving problems
Assimilation: learns by observing and taking notes

The best way to learn is to pass through all these process.
